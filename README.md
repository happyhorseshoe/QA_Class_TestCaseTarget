### For this project I chose [target.com](https://www.target.com/) . I tried to stay as close to the actual site's vocabulary and options, but there are times when I invented what would happen and wordage. The username and password are not real.<br>
<br>

### All test cases are found in TestPlanTarget.md file. Images for the Bug Report are found in PickUp5ERROR.png and PickUp9ERROR.png

# Target Test Policy
## To ensure that Target.com consumers have an easy and reliable way to find products online and the ability to find a store nearby. <br>
<br>

## Scope: We will be testing the new Pickup & Delivery option. For this life cycle we will focus only on Pickup.  <br>
<br>

## Strategy: These test cases are UAT. If these test cases prove valuable then we will use them to format automation testing for Delivery.
